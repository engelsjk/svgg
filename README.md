# svgg

```svgg``` is an automated SVG path string parser and rendering tool. It is based on the package [```srwiley/oksvg```](https://github.com/srwiley/oksvg) but modified to draw directly to an SVG context using the [```fogleman/gg```](https://github.com/fogleman/gg) rendering engine.

*Warning*: This is a work in progress. Only M line commands are currently implemented.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/engelsjk/svgg
```
